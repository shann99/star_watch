# star_watch

This project is a personal watch list for different medias that I'm watching. I can add, update, and delete different titles and view the updates page to see if 
something was released recently.

#### Technology:

I used Flask, Python, HTML/CSS and Javascript to create this web application.

- Flask because it's simple and lightweight which was perfect for my needs
- Python was used for the backend (creating the routes and database, etc.)
- HTML/CSS and Javascript for the frontend

#### Challenges:

The biggest challenge was first learning how to use Flask, how to write in Javascript, etc. and then it became: How can I go about implementing this feature? Now it's working on making the application better. 

#### Future:

In the future, I'd like to implement more features such as sort by features (ex. sort by ratings) and continue refactoring and redesinging the application.
