# star_watch
This project is a personal watch list for different medias that users watch. Users can add, edit, update and delete
their different media to keep everything up to date.

#### Technology:

I used Flask, Python, HTML/CSS and Javascript to create this web application. 
- Flask because it's simple and lightweight which was perfect for my needs
- Python was used for the backend (creating the routes and database, etc.)
- HTML/CSS and Javascript for the frontend

#### Challenges:

The biggest challenges I faced during the creation of the project were troubleshooting the routes. For example there were times that I got errors that stated a URL could not be built 
and sometimes the troubleshooting could take a few seconds (maybe I misspelled a word here or there) or it could take longer to figure out what exactly I did wrong.
I think in general the biggest challenge was trying to implement what I thought would be a good idea on paper and figuring out either how to make that happen or adjust the idea to fit
the project better.

#### Future:

In the future, I'd like to implement more features such as sort by features (ex. sort by ratings) or a search feature. I think the more I added to the different media lists, 
it will definitely get tedious to go through multiple pages to find a show or movie.

Example of an edit/update media page. You can see the current information associated with the media, which in this case is a move, and choose to update if you wish to or exit out. 
<br/> You can also see at the right, the tags that are associated with the movie. Here you can delete the tags or rewrite over the tags that are currently there to update them.
<br/> For example, maybe I wanted to change "Movie" to "movie" I could change that here and it would still be the same tag in the same location, just updated.
