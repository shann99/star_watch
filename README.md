# star_watch
This project is a personal watch list for different medias that users watch. Users can add, edit, update and delete
their different media to keep everything up to date.

#### Technology:

I used Flask, Python, HTML/CSS and Javascript to create this web application. 
- Flask because it's simple and lightweight which was perfect for my needs
- Python was used for the backend (creating the routes and database, etc.)
- HTML/CSS and Javascript for the frontend

#### Challenges:

The biggest challenges I faced during the creation of the project were troubleshooting the routes. For example there were times that I got errors that stated a URL could not be built 
and sometimes the troubleshooting could take a few seconds (maybe I misspelled a word here or there) or it could take longer to figure out what exactly I did wrong.
I think in general the biggest challenge was trying to implement what I thought would be a good idea on paper and figuring out either how to make that happen or adjust the idea to fit
the project better.

#### Future:

In the future, I'd like to implement more features such as sort by features (ex. sort by ratings) or a search feature. I think the more I added to the different media lists, 
it will definitely get tedious to go through multiple pages to find a show or movie.

Example of an update media page. You can see the current information associated with the media, which in this case is a show, and choose to update if you wish to or exit out. I decided to include the image of the title within the update media page because here you could get a good look at what the image will look like in the card without have to go back to whichever page the card is and see how it looks after updating.

<br/> In this full page view, you can see the tags associated with the show.
<br/> If I wanted to edit a tag (changing maybe mystery to comedy), I could just type comedy where mystery is and overwrite it. Deleting tags is also possible by just clicking on the red X in the top left corner of the tag.
